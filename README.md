# E-Library Management System
>>The E-Library Management System is a C program that allows users to manage a collection of books in a digital library. The system provides options to add books, view all books, search for books by author, count the number of books, and exit the program. This is the begineers level C programming.

# Features
>> Add Book Information: Store book details such as title, author, pages, and price.
>> Count Books: Display the total number of books in the library.
>> Search by Author: Retrieve and display all books written by a specific author.
>> View All Books: List all books currently available in the library.
>> Exit Program: Safely exit the program.

# Author
>> Developed as a simple C-based library management system for learning purposes.

# Learnings from This Program

# 1. Basic Input and Output Handling
>> Using printf() and scanf() for user interaction.
>> Reading and displaying structured data.

# 2. Array Handling
>> Storing book information in arrays.
>> Using multi-dimensional character arrays for storing book names and authors.

# 3. String Manipulation
>> Using strcmp() for searching books by author.
>> Handling string input and storage efficiently.

# 4. Conditional Statements (if-else)
>> Implementing menu-based functionality.
>> Handling user choices and ensuring valid inputs.

# 5. Loops (while and for)
>> Using infinite loops (while(1)) for program execution until the user chooses to exit.
>> Iterating through arrays to display or search books.

# 6. Functions and Modularity (Can be Improved)
>> The program could be improved by structuring functionalities into separate functions for better readability.

# 7. Memory Management Considerations
>> Currently, the program uses fixed-size arrays, which can lead to memory inefficiencies.
>> Future enhancements can include dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free).

# 8. User Interface Design
>> Designing a simple command-line menu for user interaction.
>> Printing formatted outputs for a better user experience.

# 9. Limitations and Scope for Improvement
>> The lack of file handling means data is lost when the program exits.
>> No validation for duplicate books.
>> Limited array size (fixed at 100 books).

# Future Enhancements
>> Implement file storage for data persistence.
>> Introduce a book deletion feature.
>> Improve user input validation.

# Limitations
>> The system uses fixed-size arrays, limiting the number of books to 100.
>>  No file storage; data is lost once the program exits.
